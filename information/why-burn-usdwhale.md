# üê≥ Why Burn $WHALE?

Most blockchains rely on coin inflation to incentivise staking which helps to secure the chain. Inflation is an almost inevitable part of a blockchain, however, it's not usually the best thing for the coin's price for the following reasons:

1. **Dilution of Value:** More coins in circulation can make each coin less valuable.
2. **Reduced Scarcity:** Higher inflation reduces the scarcity of the cryptocurrency, potentially lowering demand.
3. **Market Cap impact:** As more tokens enter circulation, the market cap of the blockchain should grow. However, as the market cap grows, some investors may think it's becoming overvalued. If the coin doesn't inflate, or better, is deflationary then the opposite is true. Positively effecting price

Burning $WHALE helps to curve these quandaries. Making $WHALE deflationary will drastically improve the chain's room for growth. Allowing the market cap to grow, or even stay the same whilst the WHALE price is increasing.&#x20;

# ðŸš™ $ASH Use cases

You can use ASH in several ways to produce yield:

1. **Staking -** \
   ASH can be staked to the Migaloo chain by using the Alliance Module. ASH is staked to a special contract called the Migaloo Accelerator which allows various Migalo tokens to be staked to the Migaloo chain providing them with yield and helping to bootstrap and "accelerate" their development
2. Provide Liquidity - \
   You can provide liquidity to ASH on two DEXs. WhiteWhale (WW) and Osmosis:\
   On WW ASH is paired with $WHALE, allowing users to maintain exposure to two ecosystem assets.\
   On the other hand, ASH is paired with USDC on Osmosis. This liquidity pool is smaller so you have the opportunity to own more of the pool and collect a higher percentage of swap fees
3. Liquid staking\
   Eris Protocol Allows users to liquid-stake their ASH. This Autocompounds the rewards gathered from staking ASH to the Accelerator contract.
